                <p>At MAST, we build artists into artist-entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>We are, all of us, defined by our stories. They are the stuff of our empathy, our hope, our ambitions. Our evolution. They give us our consciousness, our soul. We tell these stories, we all do; we all <em>should</em>. And some few can show them, conjure them visually through language, art, and motion.</p>
                <p>The tools and techniques for doing <em>this</em> are wildly different today than they were twenty years ago, or even ten. And they call for a new kind of artist: the artist entrepreneur, the artist technologist.</p>
                <p>MAST exists to discover artists, then connect, nurture, and empower them, grow them into tech-savvy artist entrepreneurs. These artist entrepreneurs will then be better equipped to create their art from <em>where they are</em>, raising a diaspora of accessible art in every city across the globe. A diverse and democratic art. A free art.</p>
                <p>This is our dream. This is our <em>mission</em>. And itâ€™s going to be a whole lot of fun.</p>
                <p>Join us.</p>

                <div class="subheading" id="labs">Labs</div>
                <p>In keeping with MAST's forward-thinking mission, our labs will cover topics ranging from novel uses of free-to-use and open-source software for keeping production costs low, to guerilla production tactics for indie content creators, to business and brand-building essentials for artist entrepreneurs. Instructors will be subject matter experts, and wherever possible, prominent influencers and advocates for the technologies and methodologies they teach.</p>
                <p>Labs are designed as an essential element of the MAST Fellowship, but are open to the public for a fee, both in-person or online.</p>
                <p>Labs will begin in April 2019, and will be announced beginning in March.</p>
