The time has come. We kicked off our MAST program this year with a trio of contests: _Voices Seen_, _People of Earth_, and _Micro-docs_.

With _Voices Seen_, we're identifying animators for our 2019 animated short written by Hubbel Palmer and Chris Bowman, and directed by Jared and Jerusha Hess.

With _People of Earth_, we're encouraging writers to collaborate with visual artists, or develop trans-media skills themselves.

And with _Micro-docs_, we're supporting short-form, socially conscious, and impactful documentary work.

We've fallen in love with a lot of these submissionsâ€”you've not made it easy on our judges! But we're looking forward to handing out some well-deserved blue ribbons, then moving on to our 2019 fellowship.

**Winners will be announced here at MastStudio.org on March 31st.**

Thanks to all who participated, sharing with us your labors of love.

Onward!
