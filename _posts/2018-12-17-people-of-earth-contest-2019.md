We are, all of us, defined by our stories. They are the stuff of our empathy, our hope, our ambitions. Our evolution. Stories give us our consciousness, our humanity.

We are the people of Earth.

Salt Lake Film Society’s MAST announces its 2019 writing and photography contest, People of Earth.

Entrants are encouraged to collaborate in pairs, and should submit an original photograph depicting one person, or multiple people, accompanied by an engaging character profile describing the person or people in the photograph.
