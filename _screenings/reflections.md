Her journey has started in loving home,

In an old little town with a broken back bone:

Conquered, set free, again oppressed-

Who in the end will this land possess?


<br />
Back to the loving home of hers:

Learning to see the beauty she was

With visual aid not hard to find

Like all those historic cathedrals around.


<br />
Silently path was chosen for her

To walk in the footsteps of those from before.

She didn't mind, that's all she could see â€“

to study and work, then start family. 


<br />
Vaccinated, gently indoctrinated

But no one noticed she had mutated.

Strong restless genes took over her mind -

Traditions and customs lost power to bind.


<br />
Finally! Ready and paid all her dues

She would no longer keep her soul on mute

With just one-way ticket and no clear plans

But with peace in her heart and excitement immense.
