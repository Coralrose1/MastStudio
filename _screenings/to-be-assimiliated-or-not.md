A MAST nod to Micro-docs 2019 finalist _To Be Assimilated Or Not_, a film by Jina Shih.

> While pursuing my master's degree in Mass Communications at Brigham Young University, I made this documentary as my professional project. I was interested in investigating the pattern of Chinese sojounersâ€™ acculturation process in the United States. Having instructions from my professors, I applied the theories of intercultural communication to explore the cultural identity of international students. 

> In Summer 2017, the main character of this documentary, Frederick Shih, started his freshman's life at Brigham Young University. This is Frederick's first time living in a foreign country. When he was in junior high school, he started to immerse himself with American culture by watching Hollywood movies. Following Frederick's daily life and hearing his story, we will see how his media use affects his journey in the United States.
