A MAST nod to Andrew Goldsmith's & Bradley Slabe's beautifully animated short, _Lost and Found_.

> We were inspired by the Japanese philosophies of Wabi Sabi, which celebrates the beauty of impermanence, incompleteness and imperfection. It varies with much of my other work in that it's much more melancholy and bittersweet. I wouldn't say it differs hugely from the rest of my work. Though perhaps since I make a lot of commercials which are often cleaner and more slick, and not as rough and organic as a longer-form stop motion starring characters made of wool turned out to be.
