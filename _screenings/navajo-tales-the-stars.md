MAST awards its 2019 Voices Seen Grand Prize to 6 animators, including Julia Berrio, Jared Mathews, and Dallin Penman for _Navajo Tales: The Stars_.

> This film was a project from the Animation Department at Utah Valley University. We had the great opportunity to work with the Navajo Nation to tell a traditional story in animated form. The film was a semi-finalist for a Student Academy Award, a finalist in the Fourth Annual Mountain Shadow Short Film Competition. An official selection at ANNY: Animation Nights New York, and a jury selection winner at the Anchorage International Film Festival.


>Navajo Tales is the traditional Navajo creation story of the stars.
This project was done in coordination with the Chinle school district
as a means to teach and preserve the Navajo language. The short film
is already part of the curriculum in the first level Navajo language
class.
The main goal for us was to create an animation that was up to the
current industry standards that could respectfully tell the
traditional stories of Navajo history.
